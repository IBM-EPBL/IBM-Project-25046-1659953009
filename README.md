Emerging Methods for Early Detection of Forest Fires

# Forest fire detection using CNN
This project is an attempt to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect the presence or the start 
of a forest fire in an image. The idea is that this model could be applied to detect a fire or a start of 
a fire from (aerial) surveillance footage of a forest. The model could be applied in real-time to 
low-framerate surveillance video (with fires not moving very fast, this assumption is somewhat sound)
and give alert in case of fire.
